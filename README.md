Number Guessing Game
This is my first project in C220: a number guessing game, written in Python. The purpose of this project was to teach me about single data types and control structures. 

First off, the player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 10. The player has unlimited guesses. 
Each time the player guesses, a message will pop up. Depending on what the player guesses, the game will tell you whether it was too high or too low. Once the player guesses the right number, a success message will come up and the player will be asked if they want to play again. If the player selects yes, they will play again. If the player selects no, a good-bye message will appear.
